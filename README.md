Welcome to my Open Library project, envisioned and designed as part of the Full Stack Development course, provided by Start-2-Impact.
The objective is to create a platform that, through API calls to OL API endpoints, recalls the lists of items (books), found for the specific input inserted by the user.
If items are found, the call receives the information and through the calling of functions, creates a card for each one of the found items.
Once the card is displayed, other than the author and the title, through the toggling positioned on an arrow element, the description of each book is visible. 
The description is also displayed through an API call to the OL endpoint, which looks up the item's key, and returns the item's details.

The application is developed by using Webpack as a bundle module compiler, which accesses the entry file located in the src folder (index.js), compiles it with other source files, in accordance to configuration details, plugins, modules, returns the output located in the dist folder.

Thank you for reading and consulting it.
I hope that you will find some new reading inspirations out there!
Sincerely,

Sara Anderlini
